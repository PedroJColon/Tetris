# Tetris-Clone

## Project Overview
A Tetris clone made with Raylib and C/C++. 
The purpose of this project is to further sharpen my C/C++ project expertise using a 3rd party library and CMake.
Because this project uses CMake, specfically Version 3.12, you are able to clone this repo, build with CMake and have all dependecies downloaded and ready to go.

## Tools Used:
- C/C++
- CMake
- Git/GitHub
- Visual Studio 2022
